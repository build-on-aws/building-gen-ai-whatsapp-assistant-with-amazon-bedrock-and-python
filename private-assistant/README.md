# Building a WhatsApp generative AI assistant with Amazon Bedrock and Python.

With this WhatsApp demo app, you can chat in any language with a [Large language models (LLM)](https://community.aws/posts/how-to-choose-your-llm) on Amazon Bedrock. Send voice notes and receive transcriptions. By making a minor change in the code, you can also send the transcription to the model.

>Your data will be securely stored in your AWS account and will not be shared or used for model training. It is not recommended to share private information because the security of data with WhatsApp is not guaranteed.

## How The App Works
![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/flow.jpg)

### 1- Message input:

![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/1_step.jpg)

1. WhatsApp receives the message: voice/text/image.
2. [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) receives the message from the [WhatsApp webhook](https://business.whatsapp.com/blog/how-to-use-webhooks-from-whatsapp-business-api) (previously authenticated).
3. Then, an [AWS Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/es/pm/lambda) named [whatsapp_in](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/whatsapp_in/lambda_function.py) processes the message and sends it to an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/dynamodb/) table named whatsapp-metadata to store it.
4. The DynamoDB table whtsapp-metadata has a [DynamoDB streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) configured, which triggers the [process_stream](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/process_stream/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function.

### 2 - Message processing:

#### Text Message:

![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/2_step.jpg)
[process_stream](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/process_stream/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function sends the text of the message to a Lambda Function . 

In this application are 2 Lambda Functions that can fulfill this function, one that uses LangChain to handle the conversations and Amazon Bedrock to invoke the LLM, named [langchain_agent_text](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py), another that uses the Amazon Bedrock API call directly named [agent_text_v3](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/blob/main/private-assistant/lambdas/code/agent_text_v3/lambda_function.py) with [Claude 3 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) , which one to use is up to you.

#### Voice Message:

![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/2_1_step.jpg)

1. The [audio_job_transcriptor](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/audio_job_transcriptor/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function is triggered. This Lambda Function downloads the WhatsApp audio from the link in the message in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/es/s3/) bucket, using Whatsapp Token authentication, then converts the audio to text using the Amazon Transcribe [start_transcription_job](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/transcribe/client/start_transcription_job.html) API, which leaves the transcript file in an Output Amazon S3 bucket.

Function that invokes audio_job_transcriptor looks like this:

```python
def start_job_transciptor (jobName,s3Path_in,OutputKey,codec):
    response = transcribe_client.start_transcription_job(
            TranscriptionJobName=jobName,
            IdentifyLanguage=True,
            MediaFormat=codec,
            Media={
            'MediaFileUri': s3Path_in
            },
            OutputBucketName = BucketName,
            OutputKey=OutputKey 
            )
```
            
> 💡  Notice that the IdentifyLanguage parameter is configured to True. Amazon Transcribe can determine the primary language in the audio.
  
![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/2_2_step.jpg)

2. The [transcriber_done](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/transcriber_done/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function is triggered with an [Amazon S3 Event Notification put item](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EventNotifications.html) once the Transcribe Job is complete. It extracts the transcript from the Output S3 bucket and sends it to [whatsapp_out](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/transcriber_done/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function to respond to WhatsApp.

> ✅ You have the option to uncomment the code in the [transcriber_done](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/transcriber_done/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function and send the voice note transcription to [langchain_agent_text](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function. 

```Python
try:       
    response_3 = lambda_client.invoke(
        FunctionName = LAMBDA_AGENT_TEXT,
        InvocationType = 'Event' ,#'RequestResponse', 
        Payload = json.dumps({
            'whats_message': text,
            'whats_token': whats_token,
            'phone': phone,
            'phone_id': phone_id,
            'messages_id': messages_id

        })
    )

    print(f'\nRespuesta:{response_3}')

    return response_3
    
except ClientError as e:
    err = e.response
    error = err
    print(err.get("Error", {}).get("Code"))
    return f"Un error invocando {LAMBDA_AGENT_TEXT}
```

#### Image Message:

![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/image_step.jpg)

[process_stream](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/process_stream/lambda_function.py) Lambda Function sends the text of the message to a Lambda Function named [agent_image_v3](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/blob/main/private-assistant/lambdas/code/agent_image_v3/lambda_function.py). 



### 3- LLM Processing:

![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/3_step.jpg)

The agent receives the text and performs the following:
1. Queries the Amazon DynamoDB table called `user_metadata` to see if the `session` has expired. If it is active, it recovers the `SessionID`, necessary for the next step, if it expires it creates a new session timer. In Lambda Function named [langchain_agent_text](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py)the chat history is managed with the Lanchain memory class, in the Lambdas Functions [agent_text_v3](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/blob/main/private-assistant/lambdas/code/agent_text_v3/lambda_function.py) and [agent_image_v3](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/blob/main/private-assistant/lambdas/code/agent_image_v3/lambda_function.py) it is solved with a Json array that is fed with the history of the conversation.
2. Queries the Amazon DynamoDB table called session Table to see if there is any previous conversation history.
3. Consult the LLM through Amazon Bedrock using the following prompt:

```
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. 
    The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. 
    If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    Always reply in the original user language.
```
4. Send the response to WhatsApp through `whatsapp_out` the Lambda Function.

> 💡 The phrase **"Always reply in the original user language"** ensures that it always responds in the original language and the multilingual capacity is provided by [Anthropic Claude](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/), which is the model used in this application.

### Step 1:  APP Set Up 

✅ **Clone the repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python
```

✅ **Go to**: 

```
cd private-assistant
```

### Step 2: Deploy architecture with CDK.

In [private_assistant_stack.py](/private-assistant/private_assistant/private_assistant_stack.py) edit this line with the whatsapp Facebook Developer app number: 

`
DISPLAY_PHONE_NUMBER = 'YOUR-WHATSAPP-NUMBER'
`

![Digrama parte 1](./imagenes/whaytsapp_number.jpg)

This agent manages conversation memory, and you must set the session time [here](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py) in this line:

`
if diferencia > 240:  #session time in seg
`

> **Tip:** [Kenton Blacutt](https://github.com/KBB99), an AWS Associate Cloud App Developer, collaborated with Langchain, creating the [Amazon Dynamodb based memory class](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/1058) that allows us to store the history of a langchain agent in an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=working-with-your-live-data-using-langchain&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq).

**To use the Lambda Function** [langchain_agent_text](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/blob/main/private-assistant/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py): change the `LAMBDA_AGENT_TEXT` environment variable in Lambda Function [process_stream](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/tree/main/private-assistant/lambdas/code/process_stream) in [private_assistant_stack](https://github.com/build-on-aws/building-gen-ai-whatsapp-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-python/blob/main/private-assistant/private_assistant/private_assistant_stack.py): 

```python
#Line 77
Fn.process_stream.add_environment(key='ENV_LAMBDA_AGENT_TEXT', value=Fn.langchain_agent_text.function_name)
```

- Configure the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

![Digrama parte 1](imagenes/image_claude_v2.gif)

## 🚀 Keep testing the app, play with the prompt [langchain_agent_text](/private-assistant/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py) Amazon Lambda function and adjust it to your need. 


## Clean the house!:

If you finish testing and want to clean the application, you just have to follow these two steps:

1. Delete the files from the Amazon S3 bucket created in the deployment. 
2. Run this command in your terminal:

```
cdk destroy
```


## Conclusion: 

In this tutorial, you deployed a serverless WhatsApp application that allows users to interact with an LLM through Amazon Bedrock. This architecture uses API Gateway as a connection between WhatsApp and the application. Amazon Lambda functions process code to handle conversations. Amazon DynamoDB tables manage and store message information, session details, and conversation history.

You now have the essential code to improve the application. One option moving forward is to incorporate [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/?nc1=h_ls) to generate more sophisticated responses depending on the context.

To handle customer service scenarios, the application could connect to [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/features/) and transfer calls to an agent if the LLM cannot resolve an issue.

With further development, this serverless architecture demonstrates how conversational AI can power engaging and useful chat experiences on popular messaging platforms.
