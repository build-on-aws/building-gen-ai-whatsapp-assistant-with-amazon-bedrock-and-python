- Better error handling
- Enhanced logging
- Improved response formatting
- Better session management
- Type hints throughout

### Better Session Management (`session_manager.py`)
- Dedicated session handling class
- Enhanced error recovery
- Better timeout handling
- Improved logging
- Type safety

### Improved Utils (`utils.py`)
- Better error handling for phone number validation
- Retries for network operations
- Enhanced logging
- Input validation
- Type hints

### Conversation Handling (`conversation.py`)
- Dedicated conversation management
- Better prompt templates
- Enhanced error handling
- Improved context handling
- Better language matching

## Original Code

The original implementation can be found in the parent directory, preserved with comments
explaining the improvements made. This helps maintain history while showing what was improved and
why.

## Migration Steps

1. Review the IMPROVEMENTS.md file in the project root
2. Test the new implementation in a development environment
3. Update your Lambda functions to use the improved versions
4. Update DynamoDB tables if needed (schema remains compatible)
5. Deploy and verify functionality

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize configuration
config = ChatServiceConfig()

# Setup session management
session_manager = SessionManager(
    table_session_active=config.table_session_active,
    session_timeout=config.session_timeout
)

# Get or create session
session_info = session_manager.get_or_create_session("1234567890")

# Initialize conversation
conversation = ConversationManager(
    config=config,
    session_info=session_info
)

# Handle message
response = conversation.get_response("Hello!")
```

## Testing

Unit tests and integration tests should be added to the `tests` directory. Key areas to test:

1. Input validation
2. Error handling
3. Session management
4. Conversation flow
5. WhatsApp integration

## Metrics & Monitoring

The improved implementation includes better logging and monitoring:

1. Key operations are logged
2. Error details are captured
3. Retry attempts are tracked
4. Session status is monitored
5. Response times are logged
